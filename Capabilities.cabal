name:                Capabilities
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Separate and contain effects of IO monad.
category:            Security, Generics
description:         
  The /capabilities/ library is an effort to make effects in Haskell
  more explicit by breaking the monolithic IO monad into smaller
  composable parts called /capabilities/: a use case might be an
  action that needs logging with current time but which should not be
  allowed any other IO. This exists as a pleasant middle ground
  between pure functions, the ST monad and the kitchen-sink IO
  providing a more fine-grained approach to effectful
  computations. Another benefit to this approach is security where a
  computation should only have access to resources requires to
  complete its job (/principle of least privilege/).

  .
  The implementation of the idea is based on Wouter Swierstra's
  Functional Pearl /Data types a la carte/ (Journal of Functional
  Programming, 18(4):423-436, 2008,
  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956796808006758>) and uses the
  'compdata' package for compositional data types.
